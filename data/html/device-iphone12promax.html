	The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the phone I have been using for over two years and for good reason. It has a large 6.7 inch display which is perfect for watching video or
	viewing large amounts of information at a time. On the back is a high quality camera comprised of three lenses, enabling you to capture great photos and videos. The
	large battery allows the phone to be used all day without constantly needing to be charged.

	In the newer iPhone Pro max models, there have not been any significant changes that would justify choosing them and their higher price tags over this two year old phone.
	However, it has been discontinued so if you were to buy it in 2023, it would most likely be refurbished. Despite this, it is a great phone that is very reliable, runs
	smoothly and I would highly recommend it.
