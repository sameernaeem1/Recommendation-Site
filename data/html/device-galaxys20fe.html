	The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has a smooth 120Hz 6.5 inch display with a small cutout for the front-facing camera, making it a visually appealing device. The rear camera with
	three lenses and large 4500mAh battery display how it is a great, cheaper alternative to the Galaxy S20.

	Even though this phone was released over 2 years ago, it is still sold brand new on the official Samsung website, proving its success. It is a great mid-range option if
	you would like to use an Android operating device rather than iOS. The blistering 120Hz panel allows you to swiftly navigate through the user interface and do whatever
	you want in seconds.
