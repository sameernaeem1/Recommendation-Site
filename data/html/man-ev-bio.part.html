<p>On 19 May 2014, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return
	to Barcelona as a manager, after he agreed to a three-year deal. He was
	recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, his former
	national teammate.[40].</p>
<p>His first competitive match was a 3–0 home league win over Elche
	CF, where he handed debuts to new signings Claudio Bravo, Jérémy
	Mathieu and Ivan Rakitić, and gave youth products Munir El Haddadi,
	Rafinha and Sandro Ramírez their maiden league appearances for the
	club, whilst summer signing Luis Suárez was unavailable for selection
	due to suspension.[41]</p>
<p>Luis Enrique suffered his first defeat in the competition on 25
	October 2014, away against Real Madrid, and although Barcelona had a
	successful run in the year, his management came under scrutiny because
	of his tactics involving several lineup changes in consecutive games.
	Moreover, a quarrel with Lionel Messi and other members of the team
	further accentuated the team's poor form.[42] After an away loss to
	Real Sociedad, there was a significant upturn in Barcelona's form as a
	result of Luis Enrique deciding on a settled lineup. He equaled
	Guardiola's record of 11 consecutive victories,[43] while the team went
	on to beat Atlético Madrid and Villarreal CF convincingly in the Copa
	del Rey to advance to the final. In the domestic league, after eight
	wins in nine matches, the team returned to the top of the table after
	15 weeks.</p>
<p>On 21 April 2015, Luis Enrique recorded his 42nd win after 50
	games in charge of Barcelona with a 2–0 victory over Paris
	Saint-Germain FC, the best record of any manager.[45] He went on to
	lead the side to the final of the UEFA Champions League and, on 17 May,
	led it to its 23rd national championship with one match to spare
	following a 1–0 win at the Vicente Calderón Stadium against Atlético
	Madrid.[46][47] On 6 June, having earlier won the domestic cup against
	Athletic Bilbao by the same score, Barcelona sealed a treble with a 3–1
	win over Juventus F.C. in the Champions League Final in Berlin,[48] and
	three days later he signed a new contract until 2017.[49] Luis Enrique
	lifts the 2015 UEFA Super Cup trophy On 11 August 2015, Barcelona won
	the UEFA Super Cup after a 5–4 win against Sevilla FC.[50] On 2
	December, against CF Villanovense for the Spanish Cup's fourth round,
	Luis Enrique decided against bringing in a new player following
	Mathieu's injury with 12 minutes to go even though two replacements
	could still be made, as the score was at 6–1 at that time and the
	manager claimed he did not want to risk further setbacks.[51]</p>
<p>In his first two seasons, Luis Enrique rotated his goalkeepers,
	with Bravo playing league games and Marc-André ter Stegen playing cup
	and European matches. Both players, however, expressed opposition to
	this policy.[52][53] A second double was achieved on 22 May 2016,
	following a 2–0 Spanish Cup win over Sevilla FC after extra time in
	which the team played more than 50 minutes with one player less,
	following the dismissal of Javier Mascherano.[54] On 1 March 2017, Luis
	Enrique announced that he would not continue as team manager after 30
	June.[55]</p>
