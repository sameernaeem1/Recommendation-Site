	The iPhone XR was released on October 26 2018 as a cheaper alternative to the iPhone XS. Unlike other Apple phones, it had many colour choices such as red, blue and yellow.
	This, along with the cheaper price point means it was an attractive option for people who wanted to give their children an iPhone. However, because of this lower price,
	there are some noticeable downgrades compared to the iPhone XS. Firstly, it has an LCD display that has a screen resolution of less than 1080p as opposed to the OLED
	display of the iPhone XS. Furthermore, it does not have the 3D touch feature or a telephoto lens for the camera.

	As the iPhone XR has been discontinued, it is difficult to buy a new one as the majority are sold as either used or refurbished. Because of this and the lower specs, it
	does not make sense to buy this as your next phone in 2023. However, it is still updated with the latest version of iOS so if you are set on having an iPhone and are on
	a strict budget, it is a decent option.
