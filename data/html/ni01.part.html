<div class="n-tag">Lionel Messi scored twice as Barcelona kept
	their La Liga title hopes alive with a scrappy 4-2 victory at home to
	10-man Valencia on Sunday night.</div>
<div class="n-summ">
	In a very erratic performance, Barca fell behind early on to an Eliaquim
	Mangala header but levelled the game through Luis Suarez. Mangala then
	went from hero to villain as he was sent off for a professional foul on
	Suarez and Messi scored from the penalty spot.

		<p>However, Luis Enrique's men struggled to adapt defensively to
			their 3-4-3 formation and Munir, who is on loan at Valencia from
			Barca, sensationally equalised just before half-time. The visitors
			dug in, but Messi and Andre Gomes scored in the second half to win
			the points. The victory closes the gap on leaders Real Madrid to just
			two points, although Zinedine Zidane's side have a game in hand.</p>
		<p>Neymar was passed fit so Barca boss Luis Enrique named the same
			team which began their last game at the Nou Camp - the remarkable
			Champions League comeback against Paris Saint-Germain. Messi had an
			early effort blocked on the line before tip-toeing around three
			defenders and curling a shot narrowly over, and Barca appealed for a
			penalty to no avail when Joao Cancelo tripped Neymar. But the hosts
			still looked vulnerable at the back and were given a warning when
			Carlos Soler forced a smart save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Munir
			then broke in behind his parent club's defence, forcing Ter Stegen to
			come out to block. And from the corner Valencia took the lead,
			Manchester City loanee Mangala rising in the area to nod home Daniel
			Parejo's corner.</p>
		<p>However, the lead lasted just six minutes before Neymar's quick
			throw-in caught the Valencia defence napping and Suarez raced through
			to equalise. A minute before half-time, Mangala tugged back Suarez in
			the area to earn his marching orders before Messi tucked away the
			spot-kick. But the drama did not end there as the 10 men immediately
			hauled themselves level, with Barca's own player doing the damage.
			This time Barcelona switched off at the back and Jose Luis Gaya
			squared for Munir to find the net, prompting a distinctly muted
			celebration.</p>
