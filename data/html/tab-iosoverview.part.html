	iOS is the operating system developed by Apple, which is used for all iPhones, iPads and iPods before they were discontinued. The first version was released on 29th June
	2007 for the first iPhone and it has been continually updated up to the latest version, iOS 16.

	One of the main reasons iOS is the most used phone operating system in the United Kingdom is because of how simple and easy to use it is. The user interface is basic and
	there is not a high level of customisation, meaning that once someone has grasped how to navigate the operating system, they should be able to use any other Apple device
	without any problems. There are regular updates to ensure security along with adding new useful features, and devices are supported for many years after release (iOS 16 is
	compatible with the iphone 8, which was released in 2017 and there are also occasionally updates for older versions of iOS needed to use older devices).

	An advantage of iOS compared to Android in many people's eyes is that there are not various unnecessary third party applications installed on it when someone buys an Apple
	device. This means the user only starts with useful apps and can download any extras they would like themselves. Furthermore, because iOS is a closed ecosystem, only Apple
	devices can use it, meaning it can be optimised to take advantage of the hardware and there is a reduced risk of security breaches as the software is not open source.

<p>
	A large factor that causes many people to swear by iOS and not even consider changing their operating system is the iMessage application, which is only available on Apple
	devices. This is different to standard SMS messaging apps used on non-Apple devices because there are many extra features such as larger message sizes, file attachments
	(which would cost extra if used for MMS) and audio messages, which can all be sent over wifi or cellular instead. iMessage is also more secure than SMS as it has end to end
	encryption.
</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, iOS is a great operating system to use if you struggle to navigate complicated user interfaces or just prefer simple and easy to use software. It is very
	fast and reliable in addition to providing many useful features you cannot find elsewhere. It also allows you to use all your data across all Apple devices your account
	is linked to.
