	<h4>Summary</h4>
	Although iOS 4 was revolutionary at the time of its release, many years have gone by and it does not hold up to today's standard.
	iOS 16 added many useful features, but it also has a tremendous number of other features from previous updates for the last 12 years
	that are not available on devices that use iOS 4. For example, iOS 4 only had SMS instead of iMessage, didn't have iCloud support,
	didn't have a file management app, did not have support for dynamic wallpapers and didn't allow the use of widgets. Furthermore,
	a big addition since iOS 4 is the 3D touch feature, which allows users to complete different tasks based on how much force they
	press the screen with. Over the course of the iOS operating system's evolution, there have also been many security updates, so it
	would no longer be safe to use iOS 4 on a personal device in 2023 because it is not as robust as iOS 16.
